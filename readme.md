# Node.js Azure Function Application

This repository contains a Node.js-based application that utilizes Azure Functions. Follow the instructions below to set up, create, and publish your Azure Function from Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. [Azure Functions Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
5. [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Azure Function Project

1. **Open Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Open the Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Azure Functions: Create New Project...`.
3. **Select a directory** for your project.
4. **Choose JavaScript** as your language for the Azure Function.
5. **Select a template** for your first function (e.g., HTTP trigger).
6. **Provide a name** for your function.
7. **Choose the authorization level** (e.g., Function, Anonymous).

### 2. Run the Function Locally

1. **Open the terminal** in Visual Studio Code.
2. **Navigate to your project directory**.
3. Run the following command to start the Azure Function locally:
   ```bash
   func start
   ```

Here's a `README.md` file for a Node.js-based application that includes instructions for using Azure Functions, creating a function from VS Code, and publishing it:
